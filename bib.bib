@article{TurkBrowne,
	Abstract = {Attention is a core property of all perceptual and cognitive operations. Given limited capacity to process competing options, attentional mechanisms select, modulate, and sustain focus on information most relevant for behavior. A significant problem, however, is that attention is so ubiquitous that it is unwieldy to study. We propose a taxonomy based on the types of information that attention operates over--the targets of attention. At the broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between external attention and internal attention. External attention refers to the selection and modulation of sensory information. External attention selects locations in space, points in time, or modality-specific input. Such perceptual attention can also select features defined across any of these dimensions, or object representations that integrate over space, time, and modality. Internal attention refers to the selection, modulation, and maintenance of internally generated information, such as task rules, responses, long-term memory, or working memory. Working memory, in particular, lies closest to the intersection between external and internal attention. The taxonomy provides an organizing framework that recasts classic debates, raises new issues, and frames understanding of neural mechanisms.},

@article{Yao,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a method to translate human EEG into music, so as to represent mental state by music. The arousal levels of the brain mental state and music emotion are implicitly used as the bridge between the mind world and the music. The arousal level of the brain is based on the EEG features extracted mainly by wavelet analysis, and the music arousal level is related to the musical parameters such as pitch, tempo, rhythm, and tonality. While composing, some music principles (harmonics and structure) were taken into consideration. With EEGs during various sleep stages as an example, the music generated from them had different patterns of pitch, rhythm, and tonality. 35 volunteers listened to the music pieces, and significant difference in music arousal levels was found. It implied that different mental states may be identified by the corresponding music, and so the music from EEG may be a potential tool for EEG monitoring, biofeedback therapy, and so forth.},

	Abstract = {The brain--computer interface (BCI) technique is a novel control interface to translate human intentions into appro- priate motion commands for robotic systems. The aim of this study is to apply an asynchronous direct-control system for humanoid robot navigation using an electroencephalograph (EEG), based active BCI. The experimental procedures consist of offline train- ing, online feedback testing, and real-time control sessions. The amplitude features from EEGs are extracted using power spec- tral analysis, while informative feature components are selected based on the Fisher ratio. The two classifiers are hierarchically structured to identify human intentions and trained to build an asynchronous BCI system. For the performance test, five healthy subjects controlled a humanoid robot navigation to reach a target goal in an indoor maze by using their EEGs based on real-time images obtained from a camera on the head of the robot. The ex- perimental results showed that the subjects successfully controlled the humanoid robot in the indoor maze and reached the goal by using the proposed asynchronous EEG-based active BCI system.},

@article{Kachenoura,
	Abstract = {Several studies dealing with independent component analysis (ICA)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have been reported. Most of them have only explored a limited number of ICA methods, mainly FastICA and INFOMAX. The aim of this article is to help the BCI community researchers, especially those who are not familiar with ICA techniques, to choose an appropriate ICA method. For this purpose, the concept of ICA is reviewed and different measures of statistical independence are reported. Then, the application of these measures is illustrated through a brief description of the widely used algorithms in the ICA community, namely SOBI, COM2, JADE, ICAR, FastICA, and INFOMAX. The implementation of these techniques in the BCI field is also explained. Finally, a comparative study of these algorithms, conducted on simulated electroencephalography (EEG) data, shows that an appropriate selection of an ICA algorithm may significantly improve the capabilities of BCI systems.},

@article{Herman,
	Abstract = {The quantification of the spectral content of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings has a substantial role in clinical and scientific applications. It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper.},

@article{Schnyer,
	Abstract = {There is growing interest in the use of neuroimaging for the direct treatment of mental illness. Here, we present a new framework for such treatment, neurocognitive therapeutics. What distinguishes neurocognitive therapeutics from prior approaches is the use of precise brain-decoding techniques within a real-time feedback system, in order to adapt treatment online and tailor feedback to individuals' needs. We report an initial feasibility study that uses this framework to alter negative attention bias in a small number of patients experiencing significant mood symptoms. The results are consistent with the promise of neurocognitive therapeutics to improve mood symptoms and alter brain networks mediating attentional control. Future work should focus on optimizing the approach, validating its effectiveness, and expanding the scope of targeted disorders.},

@article{Ekanayake,
	Abstract = {P300 (or P3) is one of the components in an ERP waveform (Illustration 2). It is a positive deflection in voltage (2-5$\mu$V) with a latency of about 300-600 ms from the stimulus onset. It is typically measured by placing electrodes covering the regions Fz, Cz and Pz (Illustration 1). Since the strength of an ERP signal is a very low it is usually hidden within the noise and not visible in a typical EEG recording. Therefore, to see the actual ERP waveform one has to bandpass filter the EEG signals (typically 1-20 Hz) and averaged over multiple trials (calls epochs, usually segments of -1000 ms and 2000 ms relative to each stimulus). The most popular experiment for obtaining P300 is called P300-speller (Illustration 3), which is a 6x6 matrix of alphanumeric characters where one of its rows or columns flashes randomly at a time in a sequence (also calls the odd-ball paradigm) while the subject is focusing on one of the characters in the matrix. Whenever the subject sees that the cell containing the character he/she is focusing flashes, the subject has to count the number of times that cell has flashed. After the experiment, the averaged epochs containing targets (flashings of focused cells) is compared against averaged epochs containing non-targets (other background flashes). What one would see is that average signal for epochs of targets forms an ERP waveform while for non-target epochs forms some kind of a random signal. However, random artifacts, such as from eye movements, within EEG recordings significantly distort the resulting ERP waveform.},

	Abstract = {Over the course of a few days, the bipotential embryonic mouse gonad differentiates into either a testis or an ovary. Though a few gene expression differences that underlie gonadal sex differentiation have been identified, additional components of the testicular and ovarian developmental pathways must be identified to understand this process. Here we report the use of a PCR-based cDNA subtraction to investigate expression differences that arise during gonadal sex differentiation. Subtraction of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) XY gonadal cDNA with E12.5 XX gonadal cDNA yielded 19 genes that are expressed at significantly higher levels in XY gonads. These genes display a variety of expression patterns within the embryonic testis and encode a broad range of proteins. A reciprocal subtraction (of E12.5 XX gonadal cDNA with E12.5 XY gonadal cDNA) yielded two genes, follistatin and Adamts19, that are expressed at higher levels in XX gonads. Follistatin is a well-known antagonist of TGFbeta family members while Adamts19 encodes a new member of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to review all randomized published trials and unpublished conference presentations on the neurofeedback (NF) treatment of pediatric ADHD, and their relevance, strengths, and limitations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Via PsychInfo and Medline searches and contacts with NF researchers 14 studies were identified and reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The majority were conducted from 1994 to 2010, with 5- to 15-year-olds, usually male and White with the combined type of ADHD. Most studies used theta/beta NF with a unipolar-electrode placement at Cz and demonstrated, where reported, an overall ADHD mean effect size of d = 0.69, a medium effect. Main study strengths, within some studies, include use of randomization, treatment control conditions, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, evidence-based assessment of ADHD, standard treatment outcome measures, multidomain assessment, and, for some studies, moderate sample size, some type of blind and the identification of medication as a concomitant treatment. Main study limitations (and directions for future research) include the lack of adequate blinding of participants, raters and NF trainers, a sham-NF/blinded control treatment condition, posttreatment follow-up, generalizability, specific details about delivery of NF, identification and control of comorbidity, and the identification, measurement, and control of concomitant treatments and potential side effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Based on the results and methodologies of published studies, this review concludes that NF for pediatric ADHD can be currently considered as "probably efficacious."},

As a research tool, Experimenter allows a variety of experiments based on classic stimulus-presentation paradigms to be run using the Emotiv. Unlike most EEG setups, however, Experimenter not only records data but also attempts online analysis and classification of the incoming data stream. With the proper experimental setup, then, Experimenter can be used as a simple mind-reading application. Experiment and application design, sample procedures, classification techniques, results, and technical details are discussed.},

@article{Duvinage,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For two decades, EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely studied in research labs. Now, researchers want to consider out-of-the-lab applications and make this technology available to everybody. However, medical-grade EEG recording devices are still much too expensive for end-users, especially disabled people. Therefore, several low-cost alternatives have appeared on the market. The Emotiv Epoc headset is one of them. Although some previous work showed this device could suit the customer's needs in terms of performance, no quantitative classification-based assessments compared to a medical system are available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This paper aims at statistically comparing a medical-grade system, the ANT device, and the Emotiv Epoc headset by determining their respective performances in a P300 BCI using the same electrodes. On top of that, a review of previous Emotiv studies and a discussion on practical considerations regarding both systems are proposed. Nine healthy subjects participated in this experiment during which the ANT and the Emotiv systems are used in two different conditions: sitting on a chair and walking on a treadmill at constant speed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Emotiv headset performs significantly worse than the medical device; observed effect sizes vary from medium to large. The Emotiv headset has higher relative operational and maintenance costs than its medical-grade competitor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although this low-cost headset is able to record EEG data in a satisfying manner, it should only be chosen for non critical applications such as games, communication systems, etc. For rehabilitation or prosthesis control, this lack of reliability may lead to serious consequences. For research purposes, the medical system should be chosen except if a lot of trials are available or when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is high. This also suggests that the design of a specific low-cost EEG recording system for critical applications and research is still required.},

	Abstract = {Lapses of attention can have negative consequences, including accidents and lost productivity. Here we used closed-loop neurofeedback to improve sustained attention abilities and reduce the frequency of lapses. During a sustained attention task, the focus of attention was monitored in real time with multivariate pattern analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging data. When indicators of an attentional lapse were detected in the brain, we gave human participants feedback by making the task more difficult. Behavioral performance improved after one training session, relative to control participants who received feedback from other participants' brains. This improvement was largest when feedback carried information from a frontoparietal attention network. A neural consequence of training was that the basal ganglia and ventral temporal cortex came to represent attentional states more distinctively. These findings suggest that attentional failures do not reflect an upper limit on cognitive potential and that attention can be trained with appropriate feedback about neural signals.},

@article{Kamitani,
	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has successfully identified brain areas that show greater responses to visual motion [--] and adapted responses to repeated motion directions [--]. However, such methods have been thought to lack the sensitivity and spatial resolution to isolate direction-selective responses to individual motion stimuli. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern classification methods [--] to show that ensemble activity patterns in human visual cortex contain robust direction-selective information, from which it is possible to decode seen and attended motion directions. Ensemble activity in areas V1--V4 and MT+ allowed us to decode which of 8 possible motion directions the subject was viewing on individual stimulus blocks. Moreover, ensemble activity evoked by single motion directions could effectively predict which of two overlapping motion directions was the focus of the subject's attention, and presumably dominant in perception. Our results indicate that feature-based attention can bias direction-selective population activity in multiple visual areas, including MT+/V5 and early visual areas (V1--V3), consistent with gain modulation models of feature-based attention and theories of early attentional selection. Our approach for measuring ensemble direction selectivity may provide new opportunities to investigate relationships between attentional selection, conscious perception, and direction-selective responses in the human brain. },
