	Abstract = {Over the course of a few days, the bipotential embryonic mouse gonad differentiates into either a testis or an ovary. Though a few gene expression differences that underlie gonadal sex differentiation have been identified, additional components of the testicular and ovarian developmental pathways must be identified to understand this process. Here we report the use of a PCR-based cDNA subtraction to investigate expression differences that arise during gonadal sex differentiation. Subtraction of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) XY gonadal cDNA with E12.5 XX gonadal cDNA yielded 19 genes that are expressed at significantly higher levels in XY gonads. These genes display a variety of expression patterns within the embryonic testis and encode a broad range of proteins. A reciprocal subtraction (of E12.5 XX gonadal cDNA with E12.5 XY gonadal cDNA) yielded two genes, follistatin and Adamts19, that are expressed at higher levels in XX gonads. Follistatin is a well-known antagonist of TGFbeta family members while Adamts19 encodes a new member of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases.},

@article{Lofthouse,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to review all randomized published trials and unpublished conference presentations on the neurofeedback (NF) treatment of pediatric ADHD, and their relevance, strengths, and limitations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Via PsychInfo and Medline searches and contacts with NF researchers 14 studies were identified and reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The majority were conducted from 1994 to 2010, with 5- to 15-year-olds, usually male and White with the combined type of ADHD. Most studies used theta/beta NF with a unipolar-electrode placement at Cz and demonstrated, where reported, an overall ADHD mean effect size of d = 0.69, a medium effect. Main study strengths, within some studies, include use of randomization, treatment control conditions, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, evidence-based assessment of ADHD, standard treatment outcome measures, multidomain assessment, and, for some studies, moderate sample size, some type of blind and the identification of medication as a concomitant treatment. Main study limitations (and directions for future research) include the lack of adequate blinding of participants, raters and NF trainers, a sham-NF/blinded control treatment condition, posttreatment follow-up, generalizability, specific details about delivery of NF, identification and control of comorbidity, and the identification, measurement, and control of concomitant treatments and potential side effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Based on the results and methodologies of published studies, this review concludes that NF for pediatric ADHD can be currently considered as "probably efficacious."},

@article{Duvinage,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For two decades, EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely studied in research labs. Now, researchers want to consider out-of-the-lab applications and make this technology available to everybody. However, medical-grade EEG recording devices are still much too expensive for end-users, especially disabled people. Therefore, several low-cost alternatives have appeared on the market. The Emotiv Epoc headset is one of them. Although some previous work showed this device could suit the customer's needs in terms of performance, no quantitative classification-based assessments compared to a medical system are available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This paper aims at statistically comparing a medical-grade system, the ANT device, and the Emotiv Epoc headset by determining their respective performances in a P300 BCI using the same electrodes. On top of that, a review of previous Emotiv studies and a discussion on practical considerations regarding both systems are proposed. Nine healthy subjects participated in this experiment during which the ANT and the Emotiv systems are used in two different conditions: sitting on a chair and walking on a treadmill at constant speed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Emotiv headset performs significantly worse than the medical device; observed effect sizes vary from medium to large. The Emotiv headset has higher relative operational and maintenance costs than its medical-grade competitor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although this low-cost headset is able to record EEG data in a satisfying manner, it should only be chosen for non critical applications such as games, communication systems, etc. For rehabilitation or prosthesis control, this lack of reliability may lead to serious consequences. For research purposes, the medical system should be chosen except if a lot of trials are available or when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is high. This also suggests that the design of a specific low-cost EEG recording system for critical applications and research is still required.},

@article{deBettencourt,
	Abstract = {Lapses of attention can have negative consequences, including accidents and lost productivity. Here we used closed-loop neurofeedback to improve sustained attention abilities and reduce the frequency of lapses. During a sustained attention task, the focus of attention was monitored in real time with multivariate pattern analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging data. When indicators of an attentional lapse were detected in the brain, we gave human participants feedback by making the task more difficult. Behavioral performance improved after one training session, relative to control participants who received feedback from other participants' brains. This improvement was largest when feedback carried information from a frontoparietal attention network. A neural consequence of training was that the basal ganglia and ventral temporal cortex came to represent attentional states more distinctively. These findings suggest that attentional failures do not reflect an upper limit on cognitive potential and that attention can be trained with appropriate feedback about neural signals.},

@article{Kamitani,
	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has successfully identified brain areas that show greater responses to visual motion [--] and adapted responses to repeated motion directions [--]. However, such methods have been thought to lack the sensitivity and spatial resolution to isolate direction-selective responses to individual motion stimuli. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern classification methods [--] to show that ensemble activity patterns in human visual cortex contain robust direction-selective information, from which it is possible to decode seen and attended motion directions. Ensemble activity in areas V1--V4 and MT+ allowed us to decode which of 8 possible motion directions the subject was viewing on individual stimulus blocks. Moreover, ensemble activity evoked by single motion directions could effectively predict which of two overlapping motion directions was the focus of the subject's attention, and presumably dominant in perception. Our results indicate that feature-based attention can bias direction-selective population activity in multiple visual areas, including MT+/V5 and early visual areas (V1--V3), consistent with gain modulation models of feature-based attention and theories of early attentional selection. Our approach for measuring ensemble direction selectivity may provide new opportunities to investigate relationships between attentional selection, conscious perception, and direction-selective responses in the human brain. },
